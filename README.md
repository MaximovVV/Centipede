# Centipede

You are a captain of the spacecraft. You have to fight with alien enemies, such as centipedes. Beware, aliens can attack at any moment, not to mention different cosmic obstacles, such as asteroids and comets, that complicate confronting enemies. You have a powerful weapon on the board that helps you to destroy obstacles and enemies. Your main goal is to keep enemies away from the bottom line and shoot them dead before they reach it. Your space ship can take only a few hits. If your ship is destroyed - you lose.
From time to time you have an opportunity to shoot special crystals that allow you to charge your weapon with a tripple shoot.
Your health is displayed in the lower left corner. The game scores and shows your achievements. You can move by pressing the W, A, S, D keys and shoot with the space bar. 
**Good luck and beware of fiery comets!**
