# Centipede

You are in space driving a spacecraft. You have to fight with alien enemies, such as centipedes. Beware of alien enemies, and also beware of cosmic obstacles such as asteroids and comets. You can shoot weapons, destroying obstacles and enemies. But know that you must not allow anyone to reach the end. Your space ship can take a few hits. If your transport is destroyed - you will lose.
Sometimes you encounter special crystals that allow you to charge your weapon with a strong charge.
Remember that your health is displayed in the lower left corner. The game scores and shows what you have achieved. You can move by pressing the W, A, S, D keys and shooting with the space bar. 
**Good luck and beware of fiery comets!**
